## The classic todo app with a few twists! 

This app is my first approach to React, developed as a solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge.
The users can:
- Add new todos to the list.
- Mark todos as complete.
- Mark todos as important.
- Delete todos from the list.
- Filter by all/active/complete todos.
- Toggle light and dark mode

## Work in progress
This app is still in progress. The next task is to build this project as a full-stack application.
